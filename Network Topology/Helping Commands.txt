In cisco,
we use router 2811 and switch 2960 and server-PT(Mail,web,DNS,DHCP) from end devices.
add cards in the router 1- WIC-2T 2- WIC-1ENET 3- NM-2FE2W
use automatic wire, so that type of wire should be correct.

Class A IP:
Subnet Mask: 255.0.0.0
public Ip:
     11.0.0.0 (11.0.0.1 - 11.255.255.254)
     63.0.0.0 (63.0.0.1 - 63.255.255.254)
     81.0.0.0 (81.0.0.1 - 81.255.255.254)
     127.0.0.0 (127.0.0.1 - 127.255.255.254)
private Ip:
       10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255

other than private ip range, all the ip between 1 to 9 and 11 to 127 are public ip in class A.

Class B IP:
Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0
public Ip:
     128.0.0.0 (128.0.0.1 - 128.255.255.254)
     132.147.1.0 (132.147.1.1 - 132.147.255.254)
     172.32.0.0 (172.32.0.1 - 172.32.255.254)
     181.0.0.0 (181.0.0.1 - 181.255.255.254)
private Ip:
       172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255

other than private ip range, all the ip between 172.16.xx.xx to 172.31.xx.xx are public ip in class B.

Class C IP:
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
public Ip:
     192.10.0.0 (192.10.0.1 - 192.10.255.254)
     192.166.0.0 (192.166.0.1 - 192.166.255.254)
     200.10.10.0 (200.10.10.1 - 200.10.10.254)
     222.63.32.0 (222.63.32.1 - 222.63.32.254)
private Ip:
       192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

other than private ip range, all the ip between 192.0.xx.xx to 192.167.255.255 and 192.169.0.0 to 223.255.255.255 are public ip in class C.

For DHCP Server:

en
configure terminal

Now to assign ip in the router by cli
ip address (network address) (subnet mask)
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
no shut or no shutdown (use any one)

Now performing dhcp:
First if you want to reserve the Ip's of your network do this
ip dhcp excluded-address ( start network ip) (end netwrok ip)
ip dhcp excluded-address 191.168.1.0 191.168.1.5

Now, create a pool by using CLI
ip dhcp pool Fast (you can use any name instead of fast)
network (network Ip) (subnet mask)
network 192.169.1.0 255.255.255.0
default-router (network address)
defaul-router 192.168.1.1
dns-server (network address)
dns-server 192.168.1.1

if in case it's not working...
you can also run these commands
int fa0/0 (with which port router is connected.)
ip helper-address (dhcp server ip)
ip helper-address 191.168.1.1

Now, also create a pool in dhcp server by manualy.
     open all the pc's and check dhcp is working or not.

For Access List:

Two types of Conditions in Access list

1- To just stop traffic from one host
Commands:
access-list 1 deny host 192.168.1.2 (ip of pc or laptop)
access-list 1 permit any

Now to stop traffic from which network, select that interface that is connected to that router.
int fa0/0
ip access-group 1 out

2- To stop traffic from all the network
Commands:
access-list 1 deny (network address) (wild card)
access-list 1 deny 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 1 permit any

Now to stop traffic from which network, select that interface that is connected to that router.
int fa0/0
ip access-group 1 out

after that pass the packets and check it is working or not.

Static Routing
en
config terminal
ip route (network address) (subnetmask) (next-hop ip address/ exit interface)
if port then port connected with its own router & if address than second address that is connected.
ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 se0/3/0
ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1

Dynamic Routing
three types of routing
1- RIP
2- EIGRP
3- OSPF

1- RIP
Now, first assign the ip's or having the ip's through dhcp server.
and also having ip in the router.

Now performing the rip routing
commands:
en
configure terminal
router rip
version 2
network (network address) (all the line of the networks that are connected with the router.)
network 192.168.10.0
network 192.168.11.0

Now, exit from here and if you want to view the routing is perform, run these commands to view that
use any one command.
show ip route
do show ip route
show running-config

2- EIGRP:
commands:
en
configure terminal
router eigrp 5
network (network Ip) (subnet mask)
network 192.169.1.3 255.255.0.0
now all the networks that are connected with the router, add them also.

3- OSPF:
commands:
en
configure terminal
router ospf 1
network (network address) (wild card) area (area id)
network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 1
now all the networks that are connected with the router, add them also.

if any of the command typed wrong, just type no before every command
such as
no network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 1
so this will remove the wrong command.
